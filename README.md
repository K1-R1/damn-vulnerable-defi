This repo contains my fork of @tinchoabbate 's Damn Vulnerable DeFi with solutions for all challenges.
Contracts that I deployed for the challenges can be found in the same folder as the challange's contracts.
Descriptions of my solutions can be found inside the `test/<challenge-name>/<challenge-name>.challenge.js` files, 
inside the `CODE YOUR EXPLOIT HERE` section.

Details of Damn Vulnerable DeFi can be found below:

**A set of challenges to hack implementations of DeFi in Ethereum.**

Featuring flash loans, price oracles, governance, NFTs, lending pools, smart contract wallets, timelocks, and more!
